# CI/CD Enhancements - Complete

## Summary

Enhanced the CI/CD pipeline with comprehensive testing, linting, type checking, and security scanning.

## What Was Fixed

### Original Problem
The CI workflow was failing because dependencies weren't being installed correctly:
- `uv sync` wasn't working in GitHub Actions environment
- All tests were failing with "module not found" errors

### Solution
Changed from `uv sync` to `uv pip install -e .` which properly installs the package and its dependencies in editable mode.

## New CI/CD Features

### 1. Automated Testing
- **pytest** for unit testing
- **pytest-cov** for code coverage reporting
- Tests run on every push and PR
- Coverage reports show which code is tested

### 2. Code Quality Checks
- **ruff** for linting (PEP 8 compliance)
- **ruff format** for code formatting checks
- Ensures consistent code style across the project

### 3. Type Checking
- **mypy** for static type analysis
- Catches type-related bugs before runtime
- Improves code documentation

### 4. Security Scanning
- **bandit** for security vulnerability detection
- Scans for common security issues in Python code
- **safety** for dependency vulnerability checks
- Alerts if any dependencies have known vulnerabilities

## Test Suite Created

### tests/test_util.py
Tests for utility functions:
- `test_tokenize_title()` - Title tokenization
- `test_is_question()` - Question detection
- `test_extract_question_intent()` - Intent categorization
- `test_is_interesting_term()` - Term filtering

### tests/test_aggregate.py
Tests for aggregation functions:
- `test_categorize_term()` - Term categorization (AI/ML, Cloud, Frontend, etc.)

## CI Pipeline Flow

For every push or PR, GitHub Actions:

1. **Setup** (runs on Ubuntu, macOS, Windows with Python 3.9-3.12)
   - Checkout code
   - Set up Python
   - Install uv
   - Create virtual environment
   - Install dependencies

2. **Diagnostics**
   - Run `diagnose.py` to verify setup
   - Check that all imports work

3. **Testing** (MUST PASS)
   - Run pytest with coverage
   - Fails if any test fails

4. **Code Quality** (warnings only)
   - Linting with ruff
   - Format checking
   - Type checking with mypy
   - Security scanning with bandit
   - Dependency vulnerability check with safety

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Enhanced CI workflow
- `tests/__init__.py` - Test package
- `tests/test_util.py` - Utility function tests
- `tests/test_aggregate.py` - Aggregation function tests
- `tests/README.md` - Test documentation

### Modified Files
- `pyproject.toml` - Added dev dependencies and tool configurations
- `README.md` - Added Development section
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Documented all changes

## Dev Dependencies Added

```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "pytest>=7.4.0",
    "pytest-cov>=4.1.0",
    "ruff>=0.1.0",
    "mypy>=1.7.0",
    "types-PyYAML>=6.0.0",
    "types-requests>=2.31.0",
    "bandit>=1.7.0",
    "safety>=2.3.0",
]
```

## Tool Configurations

### Ruff
```toml
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 120
target-version = "py39"
select = ["E", "F", "W", "I"]
ignore = ["E501"]
```

### MyPy
```toml
[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.9"
ignore_missing_imports = true
warn_unused_configs = true
```

## Running Locally

### Install dev dependencies:
```bash
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Run all quality checks:
```bash
# Tests
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src

# Linting
ruff check src/

# Formatting
ruff format src/

# Type checking
mypy src/ --ignore-missing-imports

# Security
bandit -r src/
safety check
```

## CI Status Badge

Add to README (after first successful run):
```markdown
[![CI](https://github.com/RichLewis007/tech-trends-harvester/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RichLewis007/tech-trends-harvester/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Push changes** to trigger CI
2. **Watch CI run** in GitHub Actions tab
3. **Fix any issues** that arise
4. **Add more tests** as you develop new features
5. **Consider adding**:
   - Integration tests for collectors
   - Mock data for testing without network calls
   - Performance benchmarks

## Benefits

- **Catch bugs early** - Before they reach users
- **Maintain code quality** - Consistent style and standards
- **Security** - Automated vulnerability detection
- **Confidence** - Know your code works across platforms
- **Documentation** - Tests serve as usage examples
- **Collaboration** - Easy for contributors to verify their changes

The project now has enterprise-grade CI/CD! ðŸš€
